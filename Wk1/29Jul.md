# Introduction
An operating system is a subcomponent of a tool whose purpose is to facilitate its operation.

The operating system of a computer abstracts the underlying hardware, with respect to simple services (which it provides to users or to other components of the system).
It controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various application programs running on the computer, and act as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.

The goals of an operating system are

(i) to make the computer convenient to use, and
(ii) to use the computer hardware in an efficient manner.

The OS is sometimes described as the resource allocator, program control, or kernel.
